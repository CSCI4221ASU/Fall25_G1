    Discussion Points
    
    Created the PBI and Sprint table for our group.
    
    Discussed prototypes:
    
    Overlapping Tasks and Calendar Conflicts → Prototype 1: Calendar system with conflict detection and rescheduling prompts.
    
    Notification Overload or Missed Reminders → Prototype 2: Centralized notification center with customizable alerts.
    
    User Engagement and Task Abandonment → Prototype 3: Engagement dashboard with progress tracking and motivational feedback.
    
    Decided to use Figma for prototyping and to store visuals in the GitHub repo.

  PBI
  | Tasks to do | Status | Sprint | Estimate | Assigned | Reviewer |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
  | 1. Research and document user behaviours of busy professionals using scheduling apps                                                                   | Ready for consideration | 2 weeks | One senior UX researcher for 40 hours            | Sharif Muhammod | Cameron Brown   |
| 2. Analyze time-management and expense-tracking needs of students                                                                                      | Ready for consideration | 2 weeks | One senior UX researcher for 40 hours            | Cameron Brown   | Griffin Sanders |

| 6. Prototype a User Engagement Dashboard that tracks task completion and introduces features to reduce abandonment (like streaks or progress tracking) | Working                 | 3 Weeks | Two junior developers for 72 hours               | Griffin Sanders | Sharif Muhammod |
  
  Prototype

    Prototype of Calender Section of App

    Description: 1st prototype of the weekly display of events beign schedule to the calender. Shows the events that currently schedule to for this weeky by day and time slot and allows for the input of new events to th calender. The events will display red on calender when there is an overlap or time conflict with another event. There is also a message above the calender that tells what events are conflicting.

    Discussion Points
    Drafted the product vision statement for our Calendar and Budget Management App.
    Reviewed and agreed on the PBI & Sprint Table.
    Identified and discussed three main issues:
    Overlapping Tasks and Calendar Conflicts — Users can schedule multiple events simultaneously without warnings. We'll add a conflict-detection feature.
    Notification Overload or Missed Reminders — Need smarter notification frequency controls.
    Poor User Engagement / Task Abandonment — Simplify the interface to keep it clean and intuitive.
    Selected a feature to prototype: calendar and email notification system.
    Planned to make the calendar reactive and allow users to add budgets directly to scheduled events.
    Discussed use cases, such as a student managing class schedules and expenses.

  Prototype

    Link: https://github.com/sharifmmurad/CSCI4221_Sharif/blob/branch1/README.md

    Description
    This prototype shows the Notification Settings interface for the Calendar and Budget Management App.
    Users can toggle task reminders, email digests, push alerts, and calendar notifications.
    It also allows users to set Quiet Hours to pause alerts during specific times, helping prevent overload and keeping reminders focused and relevant.

    Minutes for the Meeting
    Discussed and created the vision statement
    Discussed PBI & Sprint Table
    Issues with the program (using a student persona example)
    Overlapping Tasks and Calendar Conflicts:
    Users may schedule multiple tasks or events at the same time without realizing it.
    Without a proper conflict-detection system, this can cause confusion and missed deadlines.
    
    Notification Overload or Missed Reminders:
    If reminders are too frequent, users might start ignoring or disabling them.
    If they are too sparse or fail to trigger, users could miss important deadlines.
    
    Poor User Engagement / Task Abandonment:
    Users might stop using the app if the interface feels cluttered, unintuitive, or too time-consuming to add/manage tasks.
    This can lead to abandoned to-do lists and reduced adoption of the app.
    
    Identified one feature of the software and began prototyping it
    Discussed adding a calendar/email notification feature
    Talked about making the calendar reactive
    Created use cases explaining why someone would use the app
    Added a budget feature to track money
